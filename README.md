A traffic light color sequence repeats the color pattern RGY (in this order)  for any times including 0 times, where R is for red,

G is for green, and Y is for yellow. 

Write a C-program (or Java if you never did C before) that uses exactly two Boolean variables b1 and b2

that, for any input word w (you type it from keyboard, ended with end-of-line) that is on alphabet {R,G,Y},  returns yes if w is a traffic light color sequence;

return no if not.   

1. pls turnin code and screen shot of a sample run.

2. if I require that the sequence shall repeat RGY for at least three times,  how may Boolean variables shall I use (still two?)? pls state your reasoning.
